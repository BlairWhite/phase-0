Puts stands for "put string." It prints the output to the console but doesn't return anything.

Numbers without decimals are called integers. Numbers with decimals are called floats.

Float division returns a precise answer that can include decimals (ex. 9.0/2.0=4.5). Integer division returns an integer that is rounded down when it includes decimals (ex. 9/2=4).

puts 24*365
puts 60*24*365*10

The syntax for Ruby operations are +, -, *, /.

Integers are whole numbers - without decimals. They round down when performing operations (ex 9/4=2). Floats are precise numbers that return exact values (9.0/4.0=2.25).

Local variables can be set to user input values. For example, a program could ask the user for information, then store the input as a local variable to be used again later.

This challenge provided a good overview of the basics but it would be improved by having all instructions included in one page. Also the submission process for this is absurd.
