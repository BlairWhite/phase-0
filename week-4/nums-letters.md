Puts stands for "put string." It prints the output to the console but doesn't return anything.

Numbers without decimals are called integers. Numbers with decimals are called floats.

Float division returns a precise answer that can include decimals (ex. 9.0/2.0=4.5). Integer division returns an integer that is rounded down when it includes decimals (ex. 9/2=4).
