Open Source refers to the practice of sharing with the public how a computer program was made, and allowing anyone to customize the program as they wish.

I think Open Source is a great practice for the betterment of the coding community. That said, I can understand that not everyone wants the code that they have written to be shared.

Licenses are important because they dictate what can and can't be done with code that is published. Licenses protect your code from copyright, while still allowing it to be shared and modified.

This challenge helped me to fully grasp the commit/push/pull sequence from 1.5. I feel like I now fully understand it after failing and retrying a few times. I had been struggling with the 'git add' protocol to my feature branch, and now I feel like I understand it fully.
