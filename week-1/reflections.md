##1.1 Think About Time Reflection
I focused my learning on the idea of a "growth mindset" and creating positive habits. These concepts were attractive to me because throughout my academic career I have struggled mightily with time management and procrastination, and I hope to improve in these regards. When beginning work on an assignment, I tend to think about all the work that will go into it, making it seem daunting and difficult to choose a place to begin. This causes me to usually wait until the last possible moment to begin work, and doesn't always leave enough time to complete assignments with as much care I would like. While I have tried a few methods to improve my approach to this problem, I have not stuck with any of them long enough to achieve meaningful results. In Phase 0, I plan to make a sustained effort to develop a time management system that works for me. I plan to incorporate "Time Boxing", or the concept of blocking out a length of time in which to complete part of an assignment. I plan to start my assignments early to make them seem less daunting, and to use the 'Fogg Method' to reinforce good habits. Most of all, I hope to keep in mind that I have the ability to improve my time management so that I don't get discouraged.
## 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

A shell is software that allows a user to interact with an operating system. It allows the user to type commands and then run them. "Bash" stands for 'Bourne Again Shell' - named after Stephen Bourne who wrote the original Unix shell. A shell in OSX works in much the same way that the Finder application does, but allows the user to do more complicated work more efficiently.
The most challenging thing for me was learning the syntax of some of the commands. For example, I had to look online and try and fail a few times before properly using the syntax on the 'grep' command, which I found works like: grep 'word' filename. In the end I was able to successfully use all of the commands after looking them up online.
In my opinion, the most important commands and arguments to know are 'env' and 'echo'. Although I don't think I fully understand them yet, I think environment variables will be of great importance later on in the course.
-pwd print working directory
-ls list directories
-mv move directories
-cd change directories
-../ < I am not sure of this**
-touch create empty file
-mkdir make a directory
-less page through a file
-rmdir remove directory
-rm remove a file
-help - used with another command, shell returns tips on how to use the other command
## 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection
Create:
Log in to GitHub
Click on '+' icon in top right corner of page and scroll to 'Create new repository'
Create a name for repository, choose public/private, add license

Clone/Fork:
Go to repo page - Devbootcamp/reponame
Click 'fork' on right side of page
In new page w repo name: yourusername/reponame, copy HTTPS or SSH address
Open terminal. Navigate to desired folder using 'cd'
Enter "git clone (and paste the address that you copied earlier)
Repo now exists in that folder

The reason that you would fork a repo rather than create a new one is that you would want to edit your copy of the repo and then propose changes to the original repo. Creating a new one would not allow the two repos to communicate with each other.

This was my first introduction to git/GitHub. The instructions in the course were detailed so I did not have much trouble setting it up and using it. I learned all about the purpose of version control and the difference between git/GH.
