  When working on a programming project with a group, GitHub is an immensely useful resource. GitHub is similar to Git in that it allows users to perform version control. Unlike git, which is software located on your local computer, GitHub is an online hub where files of code can be shared and simultaneously edited by a group. GitHub is home to a "master branch", or main version of code, which can be forked (copied and downloaded) by members of the group, who can then edit it and request to resubmit their version (branch) back to the main branch on GitHub. Before the code is accepted to the master branch, other members of the group can review the code and make sure the changes/additions made by the one user are ones they want in their main branch. This prevents one person's unwanted changes from damaging the main branch.

<!-- I find myself using <section> often, as well as more individual, appropriate elements like <p>. Divs have been useful to me as well, but I am making an effort to use more semantics.

Browsers lay HTML out by rendering an entire "parent" element before moving onto the next independent element. CSS stylesheets affect the way HTML is rendered.

The only new knowledge about Sublime from this challenge was snippets. I think those will be very helpful going forward in saving time. -->
