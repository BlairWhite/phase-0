# For my table, relationship status, marriage year can have a one-to-one relationship because it is possible to have a lot of information about a person's relationship status, but NULL for wedding year because they might not be married.

# One to one databases are used when things have singular relationships to one another. They are a pair. The example given was countries/capital cities. Each country has one capital city, and vice versa.
#You would use a one-to-one database when you are storing information that has a singular relationship to other information.
# A many-to-many relationship describes a situation when one category of thing has a relationship with many items of the other category, and vice versa. These two categories of things are joined by a 'join table.'
#I imagine many-to-many relationships are very common in databases. It is easy to think of things that have complicated relationships with other categories of things. The challenge example was grocery items and lists. Clients and software providers comes to mind as another possible use.
#In a vacuum, one to many and many to many relationships make sense. However, when they are combined to create complex databases, I get confused just thinking about it. It will require patience to learn how to navigate these complex situations.
