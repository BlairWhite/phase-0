<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
Putting the HTML skills I learned into an actual site was great practice. It required me to think critically about what skils I had that would help me to copy the site.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
I did not have too much trouble researching the elements I needed to create the page.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
I was able to recreate most of the page without any formatting elements. My page looks much like the example.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
HTML is very simple and easy to use, but I think it has some limitations in design, and is a little tedious typing all the headers.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
I dont have many tricks yet, I think that will come with more practical use.
